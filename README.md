# CRTBP-Library
This code serves as a matlab Library for non-dimensional CRTBP System. Obtains: Lyapunov Orbit and Halo Orbit Parameters. Future Updates: Functions for all symmetric and asymmetric orbits (given in Daniel Grebow's Master's thesis) , Invarient Manifold functions, Resonant Orbit Functions (as in Manninie Gupta's Master's Thesis) and more. Invarient Manifold Code can be found in 3-Body_Problem Code.

Make use of following functions:
- LyapOrbitParameters.m
- LyapOrbitFamilyParameters.m
- HaloOrbitParameters.m
- HaloOrbitFamilyParameters.m
- PeriodicOrbitInvariantMfdsIC.m
